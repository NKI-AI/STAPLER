<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NKI-AI/STAPLER.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing `setup.py` 
    ```sh
    cd STAPLER
    ```
3. Install the `STAPLER` package
   ```sh
    python -m pip install .
   ```
### Data and model checkpoints

The following data is available <a href="https://files.aiforoncology.nl/stapler/" target="_blank">here</a>:
* TCR and peptide datasets used to pre-train STAPLER.
* 5 train and validation folds containing labeled TCR-peptide pairs used to fine-tune STAPLER.
* 1 pre-trained model checkpoint.
* 5 fine-tuned model checkpoints (one for each fold).
* VDJDB+ETN test dataset used to test STAPLER.

### Requirements
STAPLER was pre-trained and fine-tuned using an a100 GPU on a SLURM cluster. 
Pre-trained and fine-tuned versions of smaller model sizes will be added in the future, which will fit on smaller GPUs.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Pre-training, fine-tuning and testing of STAPLER

Inside the `tools` directory you should change the following file:
* `.env.example`: Environment file with paths to data, model checkpoints and output paths. You should adapt the `.env.example` to your local file-system and then change the file-name to `.env`. For more information see <a href="https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv" target="_blank">python-dotenv</a>.

Here you can also find the following files to pre-train, fine-tune and/or test STAPLER on a <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com" target="_blank">SLURM</a> cluster.  Also provide an argument to `--partition` to specify the partition to use. 
* `sbatch pretrain_STAPLER.sh`: Pre-train STAPLER.
* `sbatch train_STAPLER.sh`: Fine-tune STAPLER using 5-fold cross-validation.
* `sbatch test_STAPLER.sh`: Test on a test set using a fine-tuned model checkpoint. 


### Custom parameters
If you want to experiment with alternative parameters, 
you can do so in the `config` directory (implemented using <a href="https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/" target="_blank">Hydra</a>). 
The `config` directory contains the following main configuration files:
* `pretrain.yaml`: Configuration parameters file for pre-training.
* `train_5_fold.yaml`: Configuration parameters file for fine-tuning.
* `test.yaml`: Configuration parameters file for testing.


### TO-DO's

- [ ] Add support for other model sizes (pre-trained and fine-tuned model checkpoints).
